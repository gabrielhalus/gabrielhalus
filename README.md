Hi there! I'm a developer with a passion for code and plenty of coffee. When I'm not debugging, I'm:

- 🔍 Exploring new technologies
- 👥 Contributing to open source projects
- ☕ Perfecting my coffee brew

I also love staying active:

- 🏃‍♂️ **Running**
- 🥾 **Hiking**
- 🛸 **Flying FPV drones**

There's nothing like hitting the trails or capturing amazing aerial footage to keep things exciting.

Let's create something amazing together!
