## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer who runs on curiosity, code, and probably too much coffee.

I work freelance, mostly building web stuff for people and ideas I like. When I'm not buried in a project, I'm usually messing with my coffee setup, flying FPV drones, or hiking to clear my head.

You can see what Iâ€™m up to â€” or reach out â€” over at <a href="https://gabrielhalus.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my website</a>.
