## Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer with a soft spot for clean code, clever ideas, and strong coffee.

I work freelance, building web projects that try to be both useful and well-crafted. When I'm not coding, you'll usually find me fine-tuning my espresso game, flying FPV drones, or out hiking to unplug for a while.

If you're curious about what I'm working on â€” or just want to say hi â€” you can head over to [**my website**](https://gabrielhalus.com).
